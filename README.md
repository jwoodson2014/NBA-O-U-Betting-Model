# NBA-O-U-Betting-Model

Developing a model that scrapes a number of traditional and advanced statistics from NBA.com to project the total of any given matchup between 2 teams

## Background
Any NBA game can be boiled down to 3 factors:
  - Pace
  - Points per posession
  - Opponent's points per posession

Based on these factors we can project how many posessions will occur in a game as well as the projected amount of points scored and given up by both teams based on the pace at which the game will be played

*Model will continue to be updated as I continue to consider more factors and research different methods of simulation*
