# NBA-O-U-Betting-Model

Developing a model that scrapes a number of statistics from NBA.com to project the total of any given matchup between 2 teams

## Background
Any NBA game can be boiled down to 3 things:
  - Pace (How fast/slow does a team play)
  - Points per posession
  - Opponent's points per posession

Based on these factors we can project how many posessions will occur in a game as well as the projected amount of points scored and given up by both teams based on said pace
